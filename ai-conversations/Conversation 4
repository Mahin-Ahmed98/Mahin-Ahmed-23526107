Me: Why do we need perth's weather function?


AI: Good question 👍 — the reason we need a Perth’s weather function (like get_weather("Perth") or similar) is to make our program dynamic and location-aware instead of hard-coded. Here’s why that matters:

🌦️ 1. To Fetch Real-Time Weather Data

The function allows your program to connect to an API (like wttr.in or OpenWeatherMap) and retrieve current or forecasted weather data for Perth automatically — including temperature, rainfall, humidity, and other conditions.
Without the function, you’d have to manually enter this information every time.

💡 2. To Automate Analysis and Visualization

Functions like get_weather("Perth") let you use the returned data in your Python code — for example, plotting graphs of temperature trends, rainfall changes, or comparing multiple cities.
This helps when building dashboards or visualizations for climate, agriculture, tourism, or transport systems.

🧩 3. To Reuse Code Efficiently

Having a separate function (like get_weather(location)) makes the code modular and reusable.
You can simply call:

get_weather("Perth")
get_weather("Sydney")


and get data for each city — no need to rewrite API logic.

🔄 4. To Integrate with Other Programs

If your project (e.g., your weather visualization or system analysis task) uses Perth’s weather in other features — like predictions, alerts, or environmental reports — this function serves as the data source feeding those components.

Me: How can we use regular expression in NLP?

AI: Excellent question — regular expressions (often called regex) are powerful tools in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for handling text cleaning, extraction, and pattern recognition.

Let’s break this down clearly 👇

🧠 What Are Regular Expressions?

A regular expression (regex) is a sequence of characters that defines a pattern for searching or manipulating text.
In NLP, regex helps you find, clean, or segment specific linguistic patterns (like emails, dates, or words).

Example:

import re

text = "Email me at mahin.ahmed@curtin.edu.au"
pattern = r"\b[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+\.\w+\b"
email = re.findall(pattern, text)
print(email)


🔹 Output → ['mahin.ahmed@curtin.edu.au']
👉 This extracts the email address from text.

🧹 1. Text Cleaning and Preprocessing

Regex is commonly used for data cleaning in NLP before analysis or model training:

Remove HTML tags: re.sub(r"<.*?>", "", text)

Remove non-alphabetic characters: re.sub(r"[^a-zA-Z\s]", "", text)

Normalize whitespace: re.sub(r"\s+", " ", text)

Example:

text = "Hello!!!   My name is <b>Mahin</b>."
clean = re.sub(r"<.*?>", "", text)
clean = re.sub(r"[^a-zA-Z\s]", "", clean)
print(clean)  # Output: Hello My name is Mahin

🔍 2. Tokenization (Splitting Text)

Regex can split text into words or sentences:

text = "Dr. Jha said: NLP is fun! Isn't it?"
tokens = re.split(r"[.!?]\s*", text)
print(tokens)


🔹 Output → ['Dr. Jha said: NLP is fun', "Isn't it", '']

🧾 3. Pattern Extraction

You can use regex to extract:

Dates: \b\d{1,2}/\d{1,2}/\d{4}\b

Phone numbers: \+?\d{1,3}[-.\s]?\d{3}[-.\s]?\d{4,6}

Hashtags or mentions: #\w+ or @\w+

Example:

text = "Today's meeting is on 17/10/2025. Call +61-412-345-678."
dates = re.findall(r"\b\d{1,2}/\d{1,2}/\d{4}\b", text)
phones = re.findall(r"\+?\d{1,3}[-.\s]?\d{3}[-.\s]?\d{4,6}", text)
print(dates, phones)

💬 4. Named Entity Recognition (Simple Heuristics)

Before using deep NLP models, regex can help identify entities:

Capitalized names: r"\b[A-Z][a-z]+ [A-Z][a-z]+\b"

Monetary values: r"\$\d+(?:,\d{3})*(?:\.\d{2})?"

Example:

text = "John Doe paid $2,300 for the MacBook."
names = re.findall(r"\b[A-Z][a-z]+ [A-Z][a-z]+\b", text)
money = re.findall(r"\$\d+(?:,\d{3})*(?:\.\d{2})?", text)
print(names, money)

🧩 5. Rule-Based NLP Systems

Regex helps define grammatical or lexical rules for:

POS tagging (e.g., detect verbs ending in “-ing” → r"\b\w+ing\b")

Detecting negations (“not happy”, “no change”)

Extracting keywords or n-grams

✅ Summary
Task	Example Regex Use
Text cleaning	Remove punctuation, tags
Tokenization	Split sentences or words
Entity extraction	Dates, names, money
Pattern matching	Emails, hashtags
Rule-based NLP	Detect grammar or negation patterns

Me: How many attributes will return from this function?


AI: Let’s break down what attributes it returns 👇

🌦️ Typical Return Structure

A get_weather() function (whether from your custom code or an API like wttr.in or fetch_my_weather) usually returns a dictionary (JSON object) that includes several attributes (keys) describing Perth’s weather.

Here’s an example of what get_weather("Perth") might return:

{
  "location": "Perth, Australia",
  "temperature_C": 23,
  "feels_like_C": 22,
  "min_temp_C": 18,
  "max_temp_C": 27,
  "humidity": 60,
  "precipMM": 0.0,
  "wind_kph": 15,
  "wind_dir": "SW",
  "description": "Partly cloudy",
  "forecast": [
      {"date": "2025-10-17", "min_temp_C": 18, "max_temp_C": 27, "precipMM": 0.0},
      {"date": "2025-10-18", "min_temp_C": 17, "max_temp_C": 25, "precipMM": 0.3}
  ]
}

🧩 Attributes (Main Keys)

So this function will return around 10–12 main attributes, depending on how it’s implemented:

Attribute	Description
location	City or region name (e.g., Perth, Australia)
temperature_C	Current temperature in Celsius
feels_like_C	Perceived temperature (“feels like”)
min_temp_C	Minimum forecast temperature
max_temp_C	Maximum forecast temperature
humidity	Current humidity percentage
precipMM	Precipitation (rainfall) in millimeters
wind_kph	Wind speed in kilometers per hour
wind_dir	Wind direction (N, S, E, W, etc.)
description	Short weather summary (e.g., “Sunny”)
forecast	List of daily forecast dictionaries (each with date, min_temp_C, max_temp_C, precipMM)

✅ In total: about 10–12 attributes (depending on the data source).
If your code includes the forecast list, then each forecast day contains 3–4 attributes itself.


Me: What is the regular expreesion to match something from the begining?

AI: To match something from the beginning of a string, you use the caret symbol ^ in regular expressions.

✅ Basic Syntax
^pattern

This tells the regex engine:
“Match pattern only if it appears at the start of the string.”
🧩 Example 1 – Match a word at the beginning
import re
text = "Perth is a sunny city"
match = re.match(r"^Perth", text)
print(bool(match))  # ✅ True
✔ It returns True because the string starts with "Perth".
If you try:
re.match(r"^sunny", text)

It will return None, since "sunny" is not at the beginning.
🧩 Example 2 – Using re.search()
You can also use re.search():
import re
text = "Perth has great weather."
if re.search(r"^Perth", text):
    print("Starts with Perth!")

✅ Output: Starts with Perth!
🧮 Example 3 – Beginning of a line (multiline)
If you’re checking multiple lines, use the re.MULTILINE flag:
text = """Perth is sunny
Sydney is cooler"""
matches = re.findall(r"^Sydney", text, re.MULTILINE)
print(matches)

✅ Output: ['Sydney']
This finds "Sydney" at the start of a new line, not just the first line.

🔍 Summary
Symbol	Meaning	Example	Matches
^	Beginning of the string/line	^Hello	"Hello world" ✅
$	End of the string/line	world$	"Hello world" ✅

Me: Step by step approach for this function?

AI: Got you. Here’s a clear, step-by-step approach to write a function that checks (and optionally extracts) a pattern from the beginning of a string using regex.

Step-by-step plan

Identify the pattern

Decide what should be at the start (e.g., a fixed word, digits, a date).

Add the beginning anchor ^ to your pattern.

Choose flags (options)

re.IGNORECASE if case shouldn’t matter.

re.MULTILINE if you want to treat each line’s start as a “beginning”.

re.UNICODE (default in Py3) usually fine for accented letters.

Compile the regex (optional but good for reuse)

Compiling once is faster if you’ll call the function many times.

Match against the text

Use pattern.match(text) (starts at index 0) or re.search(r'^...', text, flags).

Return what you need

Return a boolean (starts or not), or the matched groups for extraction.

Handle edge cases

Empty string, leading spaces (use ^\s* if you allow them), newline behavior (with/without MULTILINE).

Reference implementation (Python)
import re
from typing import Optional, Dict, Any

def starts_with(pattern: str, text: str, *, multiline: bool=False, ignore_case: bool=False) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Returns None if no start-match.
    If matched, returns a dict with:
      - 'full': full matched text
      - 'groups': tuple of captured groups (if any)
      - 'span': (start, end) of the match
    """
    flags = 0
    if multiline:
        flags |= re.MULTILINE
    if ignore_case:
        flags |= re.IGNORECASE

    # Ensure the pattern is anchored to the beginning
    anchored = pattern if pattern.startswith('^') else '^' + pattern
    regex = re.compile(anchored, flags)

    m = regex.search(text)  # or regex.match(text)
    if not m:
        return None

    return {
        'full': m.group(0),
        'groups': m.groups(),
        'span': m.span()
    }

Examples you can paste in
1) Starts with a fixed word
starts_with(r"Perth", "Perth is sunny")         # ✅ match
starts_with(r"sunny", "Perth is sunny")         # ❌ None

2) Starts with a capitalized word
starts_with(r"[A-Z][a-z]+", "Sydney weather")   # ✅ 'Sydney'

3) Starts with a date like 17/10/2025
starts_with(r"(\d{1,2})/(\d{1,2})/(\d{4})", "17/10/2025 — report")
# returns groups: ('17','10','2025')

4) Multiline: match “Sydney” at the beginning of any line
text = "Perth is sunny\nSydney is cooler"
starts_with(r"Sydney", text, multiline=True)    # ✅ matches second line start

5) Allow leading spaces before the real start
starts_with(r"\s*Perth", "   Perth forecast")   # ✅ leading whitespace allowed
