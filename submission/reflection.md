# ✍️ Project Reflection

## AI Tools Used
What tools did you use (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot)? How did they help?
Answer: For this project, I mainly used ChatGPT to assist with coding, debugging, and understanding key concepts like API usage, JSON parsing, and data visualization in Python. It helped me simplify complex tasks such as fetching weather data, writing regular expressions, and generating clear explanations of functions. The tool also guided me through installing and using packages like fetch-my-weather, hands-on-ai, and matplotlib, which made the whole development process much smoother.

## Prompting Techniques
Which intentional prompting strategies did you apply?
Answer:I used step-by-step prompting, breaking large tasks into smaller questions, to get more accurate and focused answers. For example, I first asked what an API is, then how to fetch data, and finally how to visualize it. I also applied iterative refinement, rephrasing prompts when the first answer didn’t fully match what I needed. This helped me learn how to communicate better with AI tools and achieve precise, meaningful results.

## What Worked Well?
Describe one thing you’re proud of.
Answer:One thing I’m proud of is successfully connecting different parts of the system, from fetching weather data to generating visual graphs and creating user-friendly outputs. I was able to understand how APIs, Python libraries, and AI components work together. It was satisfying to see the app display weather information clearly and visually, showing that my logic and code structure were correct.

## What Would You Do Differently?
Describe one thing you'd change if you had more time.
Answer: If I had more time, I would work on improving the user interface and adding more cities dynamically. I would also explore error handling and real-time updates to make the app more reliable.

## Final Thoughts
Any parting comments on your learning experience?
Answer:Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience that combined coding, data analysis, and AI integration. It helped me think more critically about problem-solving and how to make technology more interactive and meaningful. I now feel more confident using AI tools and programming libraries to create practical, data-driven applications.
